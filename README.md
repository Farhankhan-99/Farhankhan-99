# Hi, there! It's Farhan! 👋

[![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-Connect-0077B5?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/farhankhan999/)

I work in data analysis and business intelligence, with hands-on experience in applying machine learning to support data-driven decision-making. I use Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI to clean, analyze, visualize, and model data to generate actionable insights and predictive outcomes.

I build end-to-end projects covering data preparation, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model development, evaluation, and dashboard reporting.

I am seeking internships and entry-level opportunities where I can apply data analysis and machine learning to solve real business problems.
