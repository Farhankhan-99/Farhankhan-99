# Hi, there! It's Farhan! 👋

[![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-Connect-0077B5?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/farhankhan999/)

I specialize in **Data Analysis and Machine Learning**, building end-to-end solutions that turn raw data into meaningful insights and predictive outcomes.

My work involves using **Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI** to clean, analyze, and visualize data, along with applying **machine learning techniques** to identify patterns, make predictions, and support data-driven decision-making.

I work across the complete analytics workflow:
- Data Cleaning & Preparation  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature Engineering  
- Statistical Analysis  
- Predictive Modeling (Regression & Classification)  
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC)  
- Dashboard Development & Reporting  

I am actively building real-world projects that combine **analysis + machine learning + business insights**.

My goal is to grow into a **Data Analyst / Junior Data Scientist role** where I can solve real business problems using structured analysis and predictive modeling.

I am open to **internships, entry-level roles, and project collaborations**.
