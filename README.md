I am a data enthusiast focused on data analysis and business intelligence, with working knowledge of machine learning to support data-driven decision-making.

I develop end-to-end projects that involve data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model development, evaluation, and dashboard reporting to translate data into actionable insights.

I am currently seeking internships and entry-level opportunities where I can contribute to solving real business problems through structured analysis and data-driven thinking.
