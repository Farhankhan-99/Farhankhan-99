## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Data Science and Artificial Intelligence student at Ramniranjan Jhunjhunwala College (Autonomous), Mumbai, currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science degree (2024-2027). As an aspiring Data Analyst, I am building strong technical skills in SQL, Python, Excel, and Power BI to transform raw data into actionable business insights.

My journey in data analytics is driven by a passion for problem-solving and uncovering patterns that drive strategic decisions. I have completed industry-recognized certifications including the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, Deloitte Australia Data Analytics Job Simulation, and HackerRank SQL (Intermediate) Certification, which have strengthened my analytical capabilities and practical knowledge.

Currently, I am focused on developing expertise in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, and dashboard development. I work extensively with Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization, while leveraging SQL for database querying and Power BI for creating interactive dashboards.

My career goal is to become a proficient Data Analyst and transition into a data professional role where I can apply my technical skills to solve complex business problems and contribute to data-driven decision-making. I am particularly interested in business intelligence, data visualization, and statistical analysis across industries like retail, finance, and technology.

I am actively building a portfolio of analytics projects, practicing SQL problem-solving, and learning advanced Power BI techniques. I am open to internships, freelance projects, and collaborative opportunities that will help me gain hands-on industry experience and establish myself as a data professional.
