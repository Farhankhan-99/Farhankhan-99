# Hi, there! It's Farhan! 👋

I focus on data analysis, business intelligence, and applying machine learning to build end-to-end solutions that support data-driven decision-making. My work involves using Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI to clean, analyze, visualize, and model data in a way that brings out clear patterns, meaningful insights, and predictive outcomes 📊.

I am actively building strong projects that reflect complete analytical workflows - data preparation, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and dashboard reporting. My goal is to grow into a data analyst role where I can contribute to solving business problems through structured analysis and data-driven predictions 💡.

I am open to internships, project collaborations, and opportunities where I can apply analytical thinking and machine learning to real-world challenges.
