## 🚀 About Me

I'm an aspiring **Data Analyst** passionate about transforming raw data into actionable business insights. Currently pursuing my Bachelor's in **Data Science and Artificial Intelligence**, I specialize in **SQL**, **Python**, and **Power BI** to solve real-world business problems.

My journey in data analytics has been driven by curiosity and a problem-solving mindset. I've worked on multiple end-to-end projects where I've:
- 📊 Analyzed **5 years** of India's petroleum sales data across **36+ states**, uncovering **112.8% post-COVID recovery** patterns
- 💪 Examined **940+ fitness tracker records** to identify behavioral trends, delivering **7 actionable recommendations** with **35%+ projected revenue impact**
- 🛒 Investigated **$29.3M** in retail sales performance, revealing critical insights on **-56% YoY decline** and growth opportunities

I believe in the power of data storytelling—where numbers meet narratives to drive strategic decisions. Whether it's building interactive dashboards, performing exploratory data analysis, or extracting insights through SQL queries, I love diving deep into datasets to uncover hidden patterns.

When I'm not analyzing data, you'll find me contributing to social causes through NSS initiatives, leading volunteer teams, or exploring new data visualization techniques.

🎯 **Current Focus**: Strengthening my skills in advanced analytics, machine learning, and cloud-based data platforms  
🌱 **Learning**: Advanced statistical modeling, Tableau, and cloud services (AWS/Azure)  
💼 **Open to**: Data Analyst roles, freelance projects, and collaborative opportunities
