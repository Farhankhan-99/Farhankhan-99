# Hi, there! It's Farhan! 👋

[![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-Connect-0077B5?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/farhankhan999/)

I focus on data analysis, business intelligence, and building end-to-end solutions that support data-driven decision-making. 
My work involves using Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI to clean, analyze, and visualize data in a way that reveals clear patterns and meaningful insights 📊.

I am actively developing a strong project portfolio that reflects real analytical workflows—data preparation, exploratory analysis, feature understanding, and dashboard reporting 🔍.
My goal is to grow into a data analyst role where I can contribute to solving business problems through structured analysis and actionable insights 💡.

I am open to internships, project collaborations, and opportunities where I can apply analytical thinking to real-world challenges.
