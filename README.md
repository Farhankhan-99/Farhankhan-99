## 👨‍💻 About Me : [![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-Connect-0077B5?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/farhankhan999/)

I am a Data Science and AI student, aspiring to become a Data Analyst. I specialize in SQL, Python, Excel, and Power BI, with hands-on experience in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and dashboard development using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn.
I have completed certifications including Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, Deloitte Australia Data Analytics Job Simulation, and HackerRank SQL (Intermediate), which have strengthened my analytical skills and practical knowledge.
My goal is to transition into a data professional role where I can solve complex business problems through data-driven insights. I am actively building my portfolio, practicing SQL, and learning advanced Power BI techniques. Open to internships, freelance projects, and collaborative opportunities in business intelligence and analytics.
